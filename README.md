# Charlotte and Jan's Power BI Projects

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to our collaborative project space where **Charlotte** and **Jan** build insightful **Power BI Dashboards**. Our journey begins with extracting publicly available data, primarily from **Eurostat** and other reliable sources. Utilizing a custom **Python API**, we efficiently upload this data into our **PostgreSQL database**. The heart of our work lies in constructing a robust datamart, facilitated by **dbt**, to power our Power BI visualizations.
